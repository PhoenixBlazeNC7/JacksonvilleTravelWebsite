  The Kingsly Plantation is a historic slave plantation that was built in the late 1790s. It was operated by Zephaniah Kingsley Jr and his wife Anna Kingsley, who was also a slave. Zephaniah Kingsley was known for his attempts to persuade the government to be more lenient toward both current slaves and emancipated ones. The plantation was built on a site near the Jackonville river. Rice, indigo, and cotton were the plantation's main exports.
